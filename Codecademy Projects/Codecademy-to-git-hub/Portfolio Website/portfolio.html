                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I have always found myself driven by a thirst for knowledge and personal growth, and these characteristics serve as the motivational foundation I need to pursue challenging projects. Having led a successful career teaching and performing music, I’m ready to diverge to the path of front-end development and experience life from a new perspective. It is enlightening for me to think about the possibilities that await me in my new career and I look forward to using what I have learned from previous experiences in new ways. 

                    My career as a musician provided me with the opportunities to experience wonderful performances at some incredible venues across the US and Europe. I became accustomed to working under pressure regularly even when the expectations are at their highest. As an educator, I had the privilege of helping my students define and conquer their goals. I tried to instill a sense of optimism, perseverance, and meticulousness into their studies because I felt it would maximize their growth. 
                    
                    At home I’m filled with immense joy from my family. Their unwavering support and love has been a constant source of motivation and has kept me moving forward to pursue my goals.
